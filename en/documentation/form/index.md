# How form works ?

With Thelia 2, form management is completely new. 
Each form has a dedicated class allowing to control many things like validation, default values, etc.

Form in Thelia 2 use Forms Symfony component. We made a wrapper that initializes all form processing for you, you just have to declare all your fields and to define options
on each field manually, such as validation. You can now use _form types_. Using form process is not mandatory but highly recommended !

# Form lifecycle

A form is displayed using a Thelia template. When this form is submitted, the data are processed by a Thelia action.

If the form is successfully processed, the customer is redirected to a success URL, which is defined by the 'success_url' form field (remember: Thelia navigation is completely driven by your templates)

If the form cannot be processed, the form "action" attribute is then used. Thus, setting the form action URL to the current view is a good way to process errors. If it's not clear, see the [form template](template.html) below.

## How to declare your forms ?

Like loops, you have to declare your form in config file using ```<forms>``` and ```<form>``` elements :

```xml
<forms>
    <form name="mymodule.customer.creation" class="MyModule\Form\CustomerCreation"/>
    <form name="mymodule.customer.modification" class="MyModule\Form\CustomerModification"/>
</forms>
```

In the ```<forms>``` element, the number of forms is not limited, declare as many form you as you want. For each form, you should define a unique name, and provide the full qualified name for class path (remember: your module must be PSR-0 compliant).

The form name is mandatory, and will be used in your templates in order to display the form.

## How to create a form ?

Each form class must extend *Thelia\Form\BaseForm*. This class is abstract and you have to overload at least *buildForm* and *getName* methods.

### getName method

The *getName* method must return the name of your form. A good practice is to return the same name as the one defined in the ```<form>``` configuration element.

This value is used by thelia for dispatching two events.
Those two events names are composed of ```Thelia\Core\Event\TheliaEvents::FORM_BEFORE_BUILD``` and ```Thelia\Core\Event\TheliaEvents::FORM_AFTER_BUILD``` 
suffixed with a point and your form name.

You can listen to those events this way:

```php
<?php
public static function getSubscribedEvents()
{
	return array(
		\Thelia\Core\Event\TheliaEvents::FORM_BEFORE_BUILD . ".my_form_name" => array("method", 128),
	);
}
```

### buildForm method

The *buildForm* method defines all the fields of the form, and the fields options, such as for each label and field validation constraints.

`$this->formBuilder` is the Symfony [FormFactoryInterface](http://api.symfony.com/2.8/Symfony/Component/Form/FormFactoryInterface.html) object, and is used to create your form fields :

```php
<?php
public function buildForm()
{
    $this->formBuilder->add("field name", "field type", array of options);
}
```

*add* method always returns the formBuilder instance, so you can chain the methods for adding fields :

```php
<?php
public function buildForm()
{
    $this->formBuilder
        ->add("field name", "type", array("label" => "field label")
        ->add("other field", "type", array("label" => "other field label");
}
```

## Validatation constraints

You can add constraints for all your fields, so that the form system will automatically detect errors. For this part we delegate all the constraints on the Symfony Validator component.
You can also create your own validator, following the Symfony validator guidelines.

The list of available validator constrains is here : [http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints.html](http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints.html)

## Fields

Some (but not all) of Symphony form definition attributes are supported :

<table>
<tr>
    <td>name</td>
 	<td>The name HTML attribute, and the form field name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>constraints</td>
    <td>An array of constraints to be checked against the field value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>value</td>
    <td>The value that will be used when rendering (commonly the value HTML attribute).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>read_only</td>
    <td>If true, readonly="readonly" is added to the field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>disabled</td>
    <td>If true, disabled="disabled" is added to the field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>required</td>
    <td>If true, a required attribute is added to the field to activate HTML5 validation. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>max_length</td>
    <td>Adds a maxlength HTML attribute to the element.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>label</td>
    <td>The string label that will be rendered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>attr</td>
    <td>A key-value array that will be rendered as HTML attributes on the field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>label_attr</td>
    <td>A key-value array that will be rendered as HTML attributes on the label.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Form types / extensions

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>This functionality is only available since version 2.1</p>
</div>

You can register form types or extensions, or event type extensions by using three tags.

### Form types

To create a form type, you must create a class that extends ```Symfony\Component\Form\AbstractType```

Then define ```buildForm``` and/or ```setDefaultOptions``` to create your type. You may also extend another type by overriding ```getParent```.

When you're done, in your config.xml, just add the service like this :

```xml
<service id="your_type_id" class="Your\Super\Form\Type">
	<tag name="thelia.form.type" />
</service>
```

### Form extension

To register a form extension, you have to use the tag ```thelia.form.extension```

```xml
<service id="your_extension_id" class="Your\Super\Form\Extension">
        <tag name="thelia.form.extension" />
</service>
```

### Form type extension

To register a form type extension, you have to use the tag ```thelia.form.type_extension```


```xml
<service id="your_type_extension_id" class="Your\Super\Form\Type\Extension">
        <tag name="thelia.form.type_extension" />
</service>
```

Unlike full-stack symfony, we register form types name directly with their "getName" method, not with an alias.

## Example

Below a complete form example, the customer creation form.

In the config.xml file, we declare the form like this :

```xml
<forms>
    ...
    <form name="thelia.customer.creation" class="Thelia\Form\CustomerCreation"/>
    ...
</forms>
```

The form class is in the file Thelia/Form/CustomerCreation.php, and contains all form definitions. We use here different constraints :
- Constraints\NotBlank()
- Constraints\Email()
- Constraints\Callback, to check specific conditions, such as duplicate emails, or non matching passwords.

```php
<?php
namespace Thelia\Form;

use Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints;
use Symfony\Component\Validator\ExecutionContextInterface;
use Thelia\Model\ConfigQuery;
use Thelia\Model\CustomerQuery;
use Thelia\Form\BaseForm

class CustomerCreation extends BaseForm
{

    protected function buildForm()
    {
        $this->formBuilder
            ->add("firstname", "text", array(
                "constraints" => array(
                    new Constraints\NotBlank()
                ),
                "label" => "firstname"
            ))
            ->add("lastname", "text", array(
                "constraints" => array(

### Back-office

Thelia provides the `StandardDescriptionFieldsTrait` trait which processes title, locale, chapo, description and postscriptum fields, used on a lot of Thelia objects.

If you want to use such field sets in your forms, just use the trait in your form definition class, and invoke the following method for adding the field to your builder :

 $this->addStandardDescFields($array);

The array parameter is a list of fields that should not be added bit the trait, for example the title if you have defined a more specific field than the one that exists in the trait.

In your template, you just have to include the `includes/standard-description-form-fields.html` template fragment to render these fields.

Example with the 'brand' modification form :

```smarty
{form name="thelia.admin.brand.modification"}

    <form method="POST" action="{url path="/admin/brand/save/{$ID}"}" {form_enctype form=$form} class="clearfix">

        {form_hidden_fields form=$form}

        {render_form_field form=$form field="success_url" value={url path="/admin/brand"}}
        {render_form_field form=$form field="locale" value={$edit_language_locale}}

        {if $form_error}
            <div class="alert alert-danger">{$form_error_message}</div>
        {/if}

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8">
                {include file="includes/standard-description-form-fields.html"}
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                {render_form_field form=$form field="visible"}

                {custom_render_form_field form=$form field='logo_image_id'}
                    <select {form_field_attributes form=$form field='logo_image_id' extra_class='brand-image-selector'} >
                        <option value="">{intl l="No logo image"}</option>

                        {loop name="brand-images" type="image" brand=$ID width="90" height="90" resize_mode="crop"}
                            <option value="{$ID}" data-img-src="{$IMAGE_URL}" {if $LOGO_IMAGE_ID == $ID}selected="selected"{/if}>{$TITLE}</option>
                        {/loop}
                    </select>
                {/custom_render_form_field}
            </div>
        </div>
    </form>
{/form}
```
